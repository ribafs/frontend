Canvas

A major addition to HTML5 is the canvas element. It is designed to provide a canvas onto which JavaScript can be used to paint all manner of dynamic images such as graphs, animated sprites, or daft cat pictures.


<canvas id="wittykitty" width="800" height="450">
    <!-- Fall-back content here, just like with video and audio -->
</canvas>
